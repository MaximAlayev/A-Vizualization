You can press, hold, and drag your mouse and every grid space it passes over will be colored and act as an obstacle.

Limitations: If you want to put down a target or start node on a particular grid space, simply press and release the mouse button, do not hold. If you hold it down it will briefly color it yellow or purple then turn black. You have about a third of a second to let go of the key after pressing it down.
